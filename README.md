## Insights Derived
1- Trade Patterns (1988-2016):

USA: Largest exporter, importer, and re-exporter of commodities.
Canada: Largest re-importer of commodities; started re-exporting commodities from the year 2000 and was the largest re-exporter by 2016. Canada also dominates the re-import trade business.
Australia: Has not re-exported commodities since the year 2000.
Re-import and Re-export Trends:

The USA has never re-imported commodities throughout the years.
Canada began re-exporting commodities in the year 2000.

2- Trade Balance Analysis:

All countries had a trade surplus from 1988 to 2016. Countries were ranked based on this observation.
It is believed that a country with a trade surplus isn't suitable for import business.

3- Top Categories and Commodities:

Top categories were identified for each country.
Top commodities were identified based on their quantity traded via export, import, re-export, and re-import.

4- Commodity Analysis:

For identified potential commodities, their quantity and unit price over the past years were analyzed.
Unit prices differed for each country.
Forecasting techniques can be used to estimate unit prices for the coming years.


These insights help identify key opportunities and trends in global trade, aiding the client in making informed decisions for their new business unit.
